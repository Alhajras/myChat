![Alt Text](https://github.com/Alhajras/myChat/blob/main/Peek%202022-09-04%2013-53.gif)

The aim of this project is to solve an issue I had where I wanted to have one website that collects all my emails and messages from all my social media.
At the moment, only Facebook is integrated the reason is that it is free; the other channels like Whatsapp and Instagram are not. 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.1.1.

## Angular Development server

Run `ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Angular Development server
Run `cd Rapid-ChatXChannels/src` and then `./manage runserver`

Login with user: `admin`, pas: `admin`.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
